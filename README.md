# vanlife-pi
Various Raspberry Pi's I plan to use in my converted bus
Some will be for luxury, others for security and data logging.

# Who am I?
Forty something Icelandic man who moved into a converted MB Sprinter 412d with his wife and kitty.
When we get to that point there are many things that I need to fix and make work in the bus for me as I am a bit of a nerd.
